This folder contains all the Matlab files required to run a Bayesian VAR in a standalone
fashion. It is a mix of files from the Koop-Korobilis archive, some of which have been
modified by me, other freely available routines downloaded from the web, and my own code.

** Ensure this folder is included in the Matlab path by typing 'editpath' then saving
